	<h1>Theory</h1>
	<b>Definition</b>
	<p><b>Tokens</b> correspond to the total number of word counts in a text while type corresponds to the total count of unique words in a text. We can say that language consists of various types of words and all the particular instances of these words are called tokens.<br><br>For Eg: Do not waste time as wasting time does a lot of harm.<br><br>Here,<br>#tokens=12<br>#types=11 (time has been repeated twice)</p>
	<b>Type vs Token distinction</b>
	<p>The type/token distinction is related to that between universals and particulars. Tokens are concrete particular instances of a general and abstract type.<br>There is only one word 'the' (type) but many instances of it found on this page (token).<br><br>The type/token distinction is applicable beyond language as well.<br>For eg:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Beethovenâs Fifth Symphony and performances of it</li>
		<li>the white elephant and specimens of it</li>
		<li>Kentucky Fried Chicken and its centres</li>
	</ul><br>
	<b>Types - (continued)</b>
	<p>Study this example again: Do not waste time as wasting time does a lot of harm.<br>Now, we notice that 'waste' and 'wasting' share a common root. So do 'do' and 'does'. Do we consider them as different types? The second approach is to consider them as a single type as inflections(different grammatical forms) of the same word (type).<br>Therefore, <br>#tokens=12 #types(root)=9</p>
