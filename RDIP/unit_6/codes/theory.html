	<b>Definition</b>
	<p>"Parts of speech" are the basic lexical categories of the words present in a language. It is very important to understand these, in order to understand the grammar and use of the language concerned.</p>
	<b>Eg:</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Ram(Noun) ate(Verb) an(Determiner) apple(Noun) with(Preposition) a(Article) fork(Noun).</li>
		<li>राम(Noun) ने(Postposition) चम्मच(Noun) से(Postposition) मिठाई(Noun) खाई(Verb).</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Each part of speech explains how the word is used. In fact, the same word can act as different parts of speechs depending on the context.<br>Eg: A noun in one sentence and an adjective in the next.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The glass was broken(Verb).</li>
		<li>The broken(Adjective) glass pierced her flesh.</li>	
	</ul><br>
	<p>Part-of-speech tagging is the process of assigning a part-of-speech (lexical class marker) to each word in a corpus.</p>
